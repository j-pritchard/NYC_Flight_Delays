**Is the number of delayed flights at Newark significantly greater than at other New York airports?**

## Average Delays
```{r}
departures %>% 
  summarise(mean(dep_delay), sd(dep_delay))

departures %>% 
  filter(dep_delay <= (mean(dep_delay) + 5*sd(dep_delay))) %>% # removing extreme outliers
  group_by(origin) %>%
  summarise(mean_delay = mean(dep_delay), median_delay = median(dep_delay))

departures %>% 
  filter(dep_delay <= (mean(dep_delay) + 5*sd(dep_delay))) %>% # removing extreme outliers
  group_by(origin) %>%
  summarise(mean_delay = round(mean(dep_delay), 1)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = origin, y = mean_delay, fill = origin)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = mean_delay),
            vjust = 1.5,
            colour = "white") +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "Mean Departure Delay Time (minutes)\n",
       title = "Difference between Scheduled Departure Time and Actual Departure",
       fill = "") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = x3colours) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Newark", "JFK", "LaGuardia")) +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  
  theme_minimal()
```
After the most extreme delays have been removed, Newark is found to have a mean departure delay time that exceeds JFK by 1.2 minutes and LaGuardia by 1.8 minutes.  All airports have the same median: over half of flights leave the gate at least two minutes before their scheduled departure time.

## Proportion of delayed flights
```{r}
departures %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>% 
  summarise(prop_delayed = sum(delayed_flag)/n())

departures %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>% 
  summarise(prop_delayed = round(sum(delayed_flag)/n(), 3)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = origin, y = prop_delayed, fill = origin)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = str_c(100*prop_delayed, "%")),
            vjust = 1.5,
            colour = "white") +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "",
       title = "Proportion of Flights that are Delayed",
       fill = "") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = x3colours) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Newark", "JFK", "LaGuardia")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  theme_minimal()
```
Almost a quarter (24.7%) of flights from Newark are delayed by at least 15 minutes, while 22.7% and 21.7% of flights from JFK and LaGuardia are similarly delayed.

## Box plot / five number summary
```{r}
departures %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = dep_delay, group = origin, fill = origin)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-30, 50))

departures %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>% 
  reframe(five_num_summary = c("L", "Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "H"),
          delay = quantile(dep_delay, seq(0, 1, 0.25))) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = origin, names_from = five_num_summary, values_from = delay)
```
Of the three airports, Newark takes the longest time to dispatch 75% of flights.


## Hypothesis Test: Are there *significantly* more flight delays from Newark?
H~0~: You are **not** more likely to be delayed if you fly from EWR than other NYC airports.  
H~1~: You are more likely to be delayed if flying from EWR than other NYC airports.  
Level of significance chosen to be 5%.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
origin_delayed <- departures %>% 
  select(origin, delayed_flag) %>% 
  mutate(origin = if_else(origin == "EWR", "EWR", "other"),
         delayed_flag = as.character(delayed_flag))

observed_stat <- origin_delayed %>% 
  specify(delayed_flag ~ origin, success = "1") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("EWR", "other"))

null_distribution <- origin_delayed %>%
  specify(delayed_flag ~ origin, success = "1") %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 200, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("EWR", "other"))

null_distribution %>%
  visualise() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = "right") +
  theme_minimal()

p_value <- null_distribution %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = "right")
p_value
```
With a p-value approaching zero, we are forced to reject the null hypothesis.  Hence, flights are more likely to be delayed if flying from EWR than other NYC airports.

After 3pm, Newark is found to have a mean delay time that exceeds JFK by 6.2 minutes and LaGuardia by 5.7 minutes.
In winter (Nov - Feb), Newark is found to have a mean delay time that exceeds JFK by 4.3 minutes and LaGuardia by 3.4 minutes.
In winter *and* after 3pm, Newark is found to have a mean delay time that exceeds JFK by 10.6 minutes and LaGuardia by 7.7 minutes.

## Are particular flights from Newark delayed more regularly than others?

            mean_delay = mean(dep_delay)) %>% 
  filter(number >= 10,
         prop_delayed > 0.5) %>% 
  arrange(desc(prop_delayed)) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

```{r message=FALSE}

There are 138 regular routes that suffer delays on most of their journeys that depart from Newark. These account for 9786 journeys in 2017 - 35% of Newark delays.

# Conclusions

Fundamentally, Newark performs more poorly than the other large New York airports when considering delays.

- On average delays are longer, especially in winter and after 3 pm
- Greater proportion of flights delayed
- Greater likelihood to be delayed at Newark, with a very high mathematical significance
- Certain routes contribute a disproportionate number of delays

Recommendations

- Allow more time on schedules, starting with routes that are most regularly delayed
- Increase ground staff in winter and after 3 pm
- Take steps to improve customer experience in the event of delay
  - food vouchers
  - improve facilities
  - entertainment
